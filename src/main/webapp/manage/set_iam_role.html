    <h3>Set IAM Profile</h3>
    <p>To allow EC2Box to access to your instance information, you'll need to create an 3rd party IAM profile with
        Account ID 652647611965, then set AmazonEC2FullAccess permissions for the role. Finally, set the
        generated Amazon Resource Name (ARN) below.</p>

    <h3>Public Key</h3>
    <p>You'll also need to register the SSH key below to allow for application authentication when provisioning EC2
        instances. Otherwise, you will have to add the key to the instances manually.</p>
